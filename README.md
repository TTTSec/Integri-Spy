# Integri-Spy
Integri-Spy is a Python-based File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) tool designed to track changes to critical files. By generating a baseline of file hashes, Integri-Spy can detect unauthorized modifications, deletions, and additions to monitored files. All changes are logged, providing an audit trail for security monitoring.
